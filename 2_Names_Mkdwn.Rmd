### Deep learning with Keras

I'm setting out to learn deep learning using the [keras](https://keras.rstudio.com/index.html) package for R. I'm excited to learn the theory and understand the guts of Tensor Flow, but while I was waiting for [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-R-Francois-Chollet/dp/161729554X) to be delivered, I decided to get hands-on with a simple model. I figured it might be nice to have a working model that I can learn to optimized as I learn the finer details of the hyperparameters.

### The Goal

If you haven't noticed already, my brand is dinosaurs (with a splash of pop culture). **Can I build a deep learning to develop new dinosaur names?**

### The Model

I had it easy for this project. [Jonathon Nolis](https://twitter.com/skyetetra) published his project to come up with [offensive license plates](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-deep-learning-to-generate-offensive-license-plates-619b163ed937) in Arizona. He based his work off of the Keras example creating new [text based off Nietzscheâ€™s writing](https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/examples/lstm_text_generation.html). He figured out that predicting letters from license plates isn't much different than predicted words from tomes. The next logical step from Nietzche and license plates is, of course, dinosaur names.

### The Data

I trained the model on `r length(kerasaurs)` genus names of dinosaurs, mosasaurs, ichthyosaurs, and plesiosaurs. The latter 3 are not dinosaurs, but I wanted to increase my training data set to include more extinct _saurs.

I also have a database of `r length(phylo)` [silhouette images](https://github.com/ryantimpe/datasaurs/tree/master/PhyloPic) of dinosaurs and other animals from my [Datasaurs](https://twitter.com/datasaurs). These will be useful later in this post, and I hope for future deep learning projects.
